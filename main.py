This is an implementation of Craig Reynolds's Flocking Algorithm, which he developed in 1986.
The Bird-oids, Boids, in the flock influence and are influenced by other Boids in its neighborhood.
Based on their neighbors attributes, the Boids adjust their velocity according to 3 core rules.
The first rule is Cohesion. In Cohesion, a Boid will find the center of its neighbors, and will adjust its velocity towards it.
The second rule is Seperation. In Seperation, a Boid will try to maintain a minimum distance from its neighboring Boids.
The third rule is Alignment. In Alignment, a Boid will try to adjust its velocity to match the direction of its neighboring Boids.
The Boids' total acceleration will be a combination of these rules.
The resulting movements and behaviour is very interesting and Boids seem to appear intelligent, that's what makes this algorihtm
one of my favorite algorithms.
